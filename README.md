# D'oH, I'm DUMB ðŸ˜©

A DNS over HTTPS server that's plain dumb.

It takes incoming DNS requests and forwards them to a traditional UDP-based DNS server,
returning whatever comes back.

It's intended to take advantage of Encrypted Client Hello features in browsers
that can retrieve the records needed for ECH from DoH servers only (like Firefox as of version 121, for example);
this is dumb on its own ðŸ™ƒ

It uses `crt.pem` and `key.pem` in the `secrets` directory to perform TLS termination.
However, in my setup, there is also a Traefik instance that sits in front of everything;
because of this, there are self-signed TLS certificates baked into the container image,
and a ServersTransport is set up to not verify them (you could also trust them explicitly in Traefik).
